Moodify - A song and movie recommendation website which recommends songs or movies based on user's mood.
This project makes use of :
HTML,CSS, Javascript - to design and code the website.
Python - which fetches songs and movies from APIs ( Spotify api for songs and TMDb api for movies)
SQLPlus - to create the database where all user data, song and movie data fetched from APIs are stored.

User first chooses between song and movie based on what they want. Songs are recommended based on the mood they choose and movies are recommended based on the genre they choose.
Users can like songs/movies from the recommendations which are saved in their liked songs and liked movies playlists.
They also have the option to view their mood selections over a period of time which gives them more insight into their emotional health.
